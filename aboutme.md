Hello! My name is Dmitry and this is my blog. 

*Short biography*: I was born in Russia. There I studied, worked and met my wife. In 2015 we moved to Prague in the Czech Republic. This place will be in my heart not only because of beautiful castles and amazing beer but mostly because my son Matt was born there.
In 2017 we moved again to the USA where we live now.

*Work experience*: I am a Build Engineer but time to time I do a job-related to development or system administration. In general, for 7+ years of a work experience, I have been automating internal build and release processes for different companies. 

*Hobbies*: A free time I spend with my wife and son, traveling, reading books(sci-fi, fantasy), playing computer games (RPG, turn-based strategies).
